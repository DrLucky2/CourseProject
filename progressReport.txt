The accepted project proposal was to create a web extension that provides information about the functionality magic cards. 
Our three tasks were to create a text scraper to determine card information, implement this scraper into a web extension, and creating an interface to displace the card information. 
Currently the scraper is nearly complete, but we are having difficulties creating a web extension as it is an area, we do not have expertise in. 
Creating the display interface cannot begin until the extension has been created.
